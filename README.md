# Pokémon Profile for Wiki Generator
The file uses files present in the PBS fan-game folder generated by Pokémon Essentials to generate wiki pages for each Pokémon individually.

The main.py script is the main one, and is adjusted to use the pokemon.txt file to extract the name, pokedex number, evolution condition, eggtype, abilities, learnsets.

For better formatting of abilities and moves, it is used to format the names of abilities and moves, in addition to extracting the type of moves.

It also uses locations.txt, which is a file generated using location.py, which is currently tuned to convert Pokémon locations from a wiki table into a simple format, but can be substituted to read locations from encounters.txt as long as follow the same output format as shown in the locations.txt example in this repository.

Additionally, because alternative and regional forms are in a separate file, I created main2.py that uses pokemonforms.txt and all other files to complement the form information based on the original Pokémon.

Warning: main2.py has problems dealing with Pokémon that have more than one form.
